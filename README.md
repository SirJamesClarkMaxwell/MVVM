# 🧪 Python MVVM ImGui Template

A modern, minimal Python MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) application template using
[imgui_bundle](https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle) for GUI rendering.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Clean MVVM architecture
- 📊 Example: interactive calculator panel
- 🔍 Data modeling with [`attrs`](https://www.attrs.org/)
- 🧵 Background processing with thread pool
- 📁 File dialog and CSV support
- 🧱 ImGui docking and multi-panel layout

---

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.9
- Recommended: use a virtual environment

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---

## ▶️ Running the App

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you're in the project root directory, and the virtual environment (if any) is activated.

## 🧪 Calculator Panel

An example panel that supports:
- Float inputs (`a`, `b`)
- Operator selection (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`)
- Live computation via ViewModel
- CSV loading capability

---

## 🛠️ Extending the Template

To add a new module:

1. Create a data model in `data/`
2. Implement business logic in `models/`
3. Write a ViewModel in `viewmodels/`
4. Create a Panel view in `views/`
5. Register it inside `App.setup_panels()`

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- Separation of concerns (MVVM)
- Easy to extend with new panels
- Async-safe design
- Clean and modular Python
